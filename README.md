## UMICH SI507 Final Project: Meal Planner

This project was made for SI507. The purpose of this project is to allow users to automatically create meal plans similar to those available for purchase at https://shop.budgetbytes.com/. This was accomplished by scraping recipe data from throughout the Budget Bytes website. Users are then able to manually add meals to a meal plan, or get recommendations by navigating a tree data strucure containing recipe keywords.
